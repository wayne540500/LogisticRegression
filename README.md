To solve this problem we need the following formula:

I choose learning rate eta = 0.01 tolerate epsilon = 0.0001 , iterations = 9999
The figure on the left shows binary classification error and empirical risk, we can see the classification looks has been done quite good.
The figures on the right about the resulting linear decision boundary on the 2D X data :
